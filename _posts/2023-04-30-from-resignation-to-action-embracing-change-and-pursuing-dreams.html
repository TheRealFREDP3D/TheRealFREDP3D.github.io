Let’s say that I finaly put my words to action: I gave my resignation to my employer. <br> <br>And let me tell you something, it was the best decision EVER! I took a week to relax and put some order in my head. I had to decide what to do next. I did not have the luxury of taking my time. I was a little panicked at first and was second-guessing my decision.<br> <br>I have taken a leap of faith and hit up some shop owners. Maybe, my two years of mechanical engineering studies could land me a job. Half an hour later, I found myself sitting in a job interview, and guess what? I totally nailed it!</p><p>I am now working as a machinist in a family-owned old-school machine shop. The job I was aiming for ten years ago.<br> <br>I’m still pinching myself. It only took me ten days to make the switch! Goodbye soul-sucking robotic job, hello new gig! <br> <br>On top of that, the shop is less than a mile from my home. I mean, seriously, what were the chances of that? I can roll out of bed and be there in five minutes flat. It’s insane!<br> <br>I haven’t given up on my cybersecurity dream. In fact, I’m feeling super confident about the future. I just had to ditch the stuff that was draining my ambition.<br> <br>Stay tuned, my friend! I’ve been doing serious work over the past couple of days. I am working on a master plan, a publication plan/calendar, to be exact. I’m getting organized, and I am, more than ever, making moves toward my ultimate dream.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><h4>My Daily Notes</h4><p>I keep a journal of my progress in “<a href="https://github.com/TheRealFREDP3D/My-Daily-Notes"><strong><em>My Daily Notes</em></strong></a>”.
