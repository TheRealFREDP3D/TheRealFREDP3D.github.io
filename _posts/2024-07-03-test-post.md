# Writing A Real Post

I am trying to understand how Front Matter CMS works. It's a VSCode Extension that simplify managing a static website. It support Jekyll which is what I use for this website. It remove having to manage server or remote files. It use Git and, in my case, GitHub Pages for the hosting. I keep a local repo of the site, and now I can use VSCode like a text editor or Obsidian. I already use Obsidian for all my notes, projects documents, coding and cybersecurity write-ups, and tons of bits of random stuff I am collecting "for later"...

I'm finding my method for reviewing my actual notebooks, rework them and publish them in a way I could be productive and begin posting stuff and by doing so, **finish** or **trash and forget** a lot of things I put on a backburner
I already use an Obsidian Plugin to open my vaults into VSCode directly inside of Obsidian.  to Right    manage content for static website.
