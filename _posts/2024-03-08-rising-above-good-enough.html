<h3>Don’t Be Another Brick in the Wall: Rising Above ‘Good Enough’</h3><figure><img alt="Book Cover — Generated with DALL-E by the author" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*C9aQsYXhEOoMes6L_BPz4Q.jpeg" /></figure><h4>Breaking Through Mediocrity</h4><p>After reading the book <a href="https://seths.blog/2024/03/graceful/"><strong>Graceful</strong></a>,<strong> </strong>written<strong> </strong>by the author<strong> </strong>Seth Godin, I felt he was addressing me. I felt inspired to write him a commentary. After realizing I had written a couple of pages, I changed my mind and decided to publish it here.</p><p>His outlined principles of life put in words describe perfectly how I have been aspiring to eliminate mediocrity around myself for most of my life. It explains a lot about my constant frustrations and the challenging periods I have encountered during my professional occupations as an adult.</p><p>Nevertheless, as I reflect, I recognize that in the end, it’s the mindset and the choices of actions I make that define my level of tolerance toward mediocrity: my own and the society I am part of.</p><p>Excellence is not a commonly valorized value anymore.</p><p>For more insights and resources from my latest literal discovery, Seth Godin, visit his website <a href="https://seths.store"><em>https://seths.store</em></a> and connect with him on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/thisissethsblog">https://twitter.com/thisissethsblog</a>.</p><p>— -</p><p>Professionally speaking, a situation that is common in my experience, is being circled by people who are living by the “Good Enough” principles. If it’s working, why try something else? Why think out of the box? It’s been working like that forever and nobody ever complained. The bosses are happy. Why should we question the traditional procedures and the enterprise traditions? Everything is perfectly perfect!</p><p>From where you’re standing, consider who could benefit the most from the extra efforts to level up the workflow. Management? Shareholders? The Suzies?</p><p>— -</p><h4>The Suzies</h4><p>We all know her. It’s the one crossing the days left until her deserved, hard-worked (<em>good enough</em>) retirement days. <br>“Don’t give up Suz.” Only 3985 days left until <em>The End of the Great Void.</em></p><p>“<em>Good enough</em>” days remembering how mediocre and meaningless your life was, punching in, punching out and on a good day, maybe you had a third coffee and pushed a pen on some useless papers, putting them in a brown folder knowing that ten years later, they are doomed and will probably end up shredded, in a single trash truck trip to be incinerated and buried in a landfill with all the other countless forms you filled during your active life.</p><p>Another day crossed Suzy. Keep up the good work!</p><p>And you know what?</p><p>Maybe she is the smart one, happier and more fulfilled than I will ever be. Maybe I was dropped on the head during childhood and I have a limited cognitive capacity. Sometimes, I wished it was the case. Life could be easy for me too.</p><p>— -</p><h4>Extra Miles Mindset</h4><p>Going the extra mile isn’t just a <em>cliché</em>; it’s the path to personal growth and achievement. In my case, I can live with myself and sleep at night because I’m not a ‘dial tone’ on two legs and surely never will. I’m just unable to accept the <em>Good Enough </em>mindset society adopted.</p><p>— -</p><h4>Aiming higher than “Good Enough”</h4><p>Not the easiest road my friends… Be prepared for potential pushback. Some individuals, often the “Brick in the Wall” archetype, might react strangely:</p><p><strong>Frustration:</strong> They might question your methods, accusing you of cheating or undermining their efforts. Their frustration stems from feeling threatened by your success. They may resist change, insisting on sticking to The Ways of doing things around here, the status quo, fearing repercussions from higher-ups.</p><p><strong>Sabotage:</strong> Some may actively try to undermine your efforts, emphasizing any mistakes you make or even redoing your work to prove their point. Others might gossip to coworkers, painting you as a reckless troublemaker endangering the group cohesion by stepping out of the established (<em>Good Enough</em>) order.</p><p>— -</p><p>Yet, on the brighter side, dedication can be a beacon of inspiration for others. Many have quietly suffered, settling for mediocrity due to the prevailing norms around them. Fearing to displease a coworker or to be put aside from the group.</p><h4>My deep-rooted principles</h4><p><strong>Never Settle for Average</strong>: Always strive for excellence, pushing beyond what’s expected.<br><strong>Lead by Example:</strong> Under-promise and overachieve, letting your actions speak louder than words.<br><strong>Elevate Others:</strong> Inspire those around you to aim higher and reach their full potential.</p><p>By embodying these principles, you not only elevate yourself but also those around you, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and excellence.</p><p>— -</p><p><strong>P.S. </strong>I had a really specific person in mind when I took Suzan as an example. She was an English teacher at my high school (26 years ago). I was displeased by the fact that she always answered my ‘out-of-order’ questions with her monotone boring voice: “This will not be in the tests, please stay focused on the topic. Other questions? Good!”</p><p>Her name was, you may have guessed: Madam Suzie…</p><p>I realized that I learned a more important lesson than English at the time. I wasn’t alone. Most of my classmates were also hungry for more than the “Good Enough” classes she offered us.</p><p>We took action and organized English-only parties. We played AD&amp;D sessions on the weekends trying to speak only using English. We started to watch movies with their original soundtrack.</p><p>And you know what? At the end of class, our small group obtained the best test scores since the school&#39;s foundation.</p><p>— -</p><p>I will conclude with this small historical fact:</p><blockquote>“Le Petit Séminaire de Québec, established in 1668 by Bishop François de Laval, is one of North America’s oldest educational institutions. Initially a seminary for religious vocations, it has evolved into a prestigious secondary school with rigorous academic standards and a holistic approach to education. Located in Quebec City’s Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site, the school offers diverse academic programs in humanities, sciences, arts, and languages. With modern facilities and dedicated educators, Le Petit Séminaire emphasizes intellectual development, character formation, and extracurricular activities to provide students with a transformative educational experience.”</blockquote><blockquote>Summarized by Merlin</blockquote><p>— -</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p>Feel free to reach me on <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealFredP3D">Twitter</a>.</p><p>— -</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=613b9951d100" width="1" height="1" alt="">
