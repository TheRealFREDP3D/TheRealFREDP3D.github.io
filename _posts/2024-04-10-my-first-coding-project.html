After diving into my memories, this text came out.</p><p>My response to this question might evoke some nostalgia and amusement… Please refrain from laughing too loudly because I might join in!</p><p>Let me take you back to when I embarked on my first coding adventure: creating a website dedicated to the legendary Diablo PC game. Picture this — it was 1996, and the internet was the Next Big Thing. Armed with a bright yellow book titled “HTML for Dummies” that I stumbled upon in the library, I dove headfirst into the world of web development.</p><p>HTML was refreshingly simple back then, and armed with just a dash of JavaScript 1.1 knowledge, I set out to bring my Diablo tribute to life. My trusty companion? None other than notepad.exe — the unsung hero of my coding journey.</p><p>Despite having limited computer access — a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes per week — I was undeterred. My favourite coding spot? The bus, where I meticulously crafted HTML pages in thick notebooks. Once a week, I would eagerly type out my handwritten code, bringing to fruition what would become the “Site de référence par excellence sur le jeu Diablo” — a modest success that garnered attention in magazines and fueled my burgeoning love for coding and creating.</p><p>Fast forward 25+ years, and here I am, reminiscing like an old record…</p><p>Ah, but wait! There’s more. For those curious souls, I recently unearthed an old backup of the website, now preserved for posterity on my GitHub. Behold, my Diablo time capsule:</p><p><strong>My Diablo Website — 1996</strong></p><p><a href="https://github.com/TheRealFREDP3D/My-Diablo-Website-1996/blob/main/index.html">https://github.com/TheRealFREDP3D/My-Diablo-Website-1996/blob/main/index.html</a></p><p>Take a stroll down memory lane and witness firsthand the humble beginnings of web development. It’s a testament to the journey that sparked my enduring passion for coding and learning.</p><p>So, what started as a simple coding project all those years ago has blossomed into a lifelong journey filled with discovery and wonder. Who knew that a fascination with a PC game would pave the way for a love affair with technology?</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=45f796d95197" width="1" height="1" alt="">
