It can help you achieve your goals and advance your career. As someone who struggled in school but has since been self-taught, I know firsthand how challenging and rewarding self-education can be. In this text, I’ll share how I learn and train new skills, how to choose learning resources, develop effective note-taking habits, and make the most of hands-on exercises.</p><p>I have recently decided to learn Cybersecurity and IT. I’m on a long run to get myself into a new field of work. As a beginner, I quickly understood I had a lot to learn. IT and cybersecurity are expansive field of knowledge. I had to do my homework and learn the fundamentals. I needed to become educated enough so I could enroll in serious training from serious learning platform like Hackthebox, Cybrary, Pentesterlab to name a few.</p><p>How I Self-Educate</p><p>When I want to learn something new, I do a lot of research to find good online courses, tutorials or books. Here are the things I’m looking for at first:</p><ul><li>Check if a “For Dummies” book exists. They are written in a way that is easy to understand for beginners. They provide a good overview of the subject.</li><li>GitHub Repositories are an endless source of knowledge and hands-on learning material. It’s a platform for developers to share code and collaborate, and many developers post tutorials, code examples, and projects on GitHub that are good for learning.</li><li>Google and follow links. Take bookmarks of anything that looks promising. You never know what information could be relevant later.</li></ul><p>My Note Taking Habit</p><p>I’m a compulsive note taking person. Since last October, I have written more than 1000 pages of notes. I’m not handwriting them. For this task, I use <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. It is a good tool for copy-pasting web contents, screenshot-pasting into a note. I use it for everything. I use it to manage my daily-notes, my sticky-notes, the progression of my enrolled courses, and my calendar.</p><p>I always create a note folder for new search I make. It is a good idea to keep an open mind when researching new topics. Save any resources that seem valuable or helpful, even if you can’t be sure how they could be relevant in the future.</p><p>I organize things so they stay organized. When I don’t know where to place a new note, I put them in the folder ‘_TRL To-Review-Later’. I also put a “TRL” tag in the note’s header so I can review it later and evaluate it’s final destination: a proper folder or the trash. It’s easier when knowing more about the subject than the day I makedthe note.</p><p>A recent example of my self-learning workflow:</p><p>I recently faced a challenge I couldn’t solve on Hackthebox Academy while studying <a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/33">SQL Injection Fundamentals</a>. I conducted some research and found two valuable resources: Sololearn.com — Introduction to SQL and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-sql/">Codecademy.com — Learn SQL</a>. I complete the two courses in parallel to get the most out of both courses. The theory was nearly the same in both courses but the hands-on exercises where totally different. This approach is my preferred learning style. I always prioritize hands-on exercises and little projects.</p><p>Tonight, I successfully completed the Sololearn.com course, ‘Introduction to SQL,’</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kuzrmNEZjLTyZY6bH3gR2A.jpeg" /><figcaption>Sololearn — Introduction to SQL — Certificate, by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>and I plan to finish the Codecademy.com course tomorrow. Armed with these new skills and knowledge, I’m eager to return to HTB Academy to see if my extra training will be enough to let me finish the Academy module.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p><p>So, this is my second story on Medium. I’m starting to get a picture of what I want to share with others. Please bear with me as I continue to improve. English is my second language and this is my first attempt at writing technical articles.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ef4c6f147f6e" width="1" height="1" alt="">
