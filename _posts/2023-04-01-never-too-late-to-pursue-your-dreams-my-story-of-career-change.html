I’m not a professional writer, a marketing guru, a crypto evangelist, or a purveyor of miracles. I’m just an average individual, no more and no less. My life journey has been far from ordinary, characterized by its unique twists and turns. Yet, today, I’m here to share my vision for the coming months and years.</p><p>Before we dive deeper, it’s essential to grasp that my journey has been far from ordinary. I’ve professionally worn many hats, from waiting tables and doing security gigs to running retail shops. Through it all, I’ve always brought my A-game, professionally earning the respect of both colleagues and bosses. But hey, I’m not one to be defined by job titles.</p><p>For some time, I have harboured a profound passion for everything related to computers. During my teenage years, I dabbled in the creation of small games and websites. The world of hacking, computer repairs, upgrades, and trading became my playground. Computers, in a way, have been my lifelong companions.</p><p>Approaching my 38th birthday, I made a pivotal decision: to pursue my dream career in the realm of IT. I recognized that my self-taught skills and abilities could find their true calling in this field. I am now six months into studying cybersecurity, ethical hacking, cloud computing (including AWS and Azure), and programming (specifically SQL and Python). The learning process has been not only enjoyable but also incredibly fulfilling. I’m dedicated to honing my skills daily, actively engaging with platforms like HackTheBox and Tryhackme to sharpen my hacking expertise. Soon, I’ll obtain my first AWS Cloud certificate. I also dedicate time to Python coding exercises. My motivation is soaring, and I’m filled with enthusiasm for the future.</p><p>Throughout my life, I have maintained a commitment to learning on my terms. Practical, hands-on learning has been my modus operandi. Now, my motivation stems from a deep passion for emerging technologies, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and programming. Delving into these subjects, reading voraciously, and engaging in practical exercises are not mere responsibilities; they are my sources of joy. In light of this passion, I came up with the idea of chronicling the journey of a middle-aged individual traversing a challenging path toward his aspirations.</p><p>And here we are!</p><p>In the past, I was deeply immersed in the fields of mechanical engineering, machining, and inventiveness. At one juncture, I pursued higher education for two years. Regrettably, the traditional classroom setting did not align with my learning style, leading to my decision to discontinue my studies.</p><p>During my academic pursuits, I simultaneously continued my ascent in my professional career. While diligently attending school, I remained active in the workforce, continuously striving to advance. Juggling the demands of education with the responsibilities of my job, I demonstrated an unwavering commitment to both domains.</p><p>On the side, I engaged in occasional freelance work, predominantly in the realm of technology. My most recent project was a small 3D printing startup, which I recently placed on the back burner.</p><p>It is essential to note that my contributions to my employers were, as they always have been, commendable. Nevertheless, a growing inner voice has been urging me to explore new horizons. This voice has grown louder in recent times, prompting me to embark on the transformative journey I find myself on today.</p><p>My journey toward reorienting my career path began with an online AWS Certified Practitioner course on New Year’s Eve. Since then, I have devoted nearly all my available time to the study of cybersecurity. Self-paced courses, along with independent learning, have become my daily regimen. My areas of focus encompass computer networking, ethical hacking, cloud computing, and Python programming. This journey represents a significant shift in my life, and the past several months have been a period of intense immersion in these subjects. I’ve been expanding my knowledge and skills, seeking to build a solid foundation.</p><p>I’ve also dedicated time to improving my proficiency in the English language. Today, I possess the confidence to communicate effectively about my passions and to share my achievements and challenges.</p><p>I’m excited about the possibilities that the future holds. I believe I possess the qualities required to elevate my life to new heights. I recognize that this is not a sprint; it’s a journey of endurance and self-improvement that I’ve long been preparing for.</p><p>It’s time to shine!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qzgyr_ITbsmJ4E-GCKauJg.jpeg" /><figcaption>Image generated using DALL-E by the author</figcaption></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6d27707650d2" width="1" height="1" alt="">
